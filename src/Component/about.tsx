                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    For a few years, I worked as a Front-End Web Developer for Pannos Marketing, sharpening my skills in
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C# and more. I’ve also spent a bit of time working on independent projects.
                    I believe I am the perfect candidate for a full stack web developer position not because of my unmatched
                    work ethic or ability to create various websites specific to an organization’s needs.
                    No, I believe I am the perfect candidate because I want to use the experience, I’ve gained to impact the
                    organization as well as the everyday people that use the site to fit their needs.
                    My goal is to continue to grow in the IT field and be great at it. A new opportunity would be the
                    catalyst to acheiving my goal.
                </p>

                    I’m not unfamiliar with using my experience to improve the experience of others. While I was an Airman
                    for the Air Force,
                    I taught myself how to perform a sensitive vibration calibration with a brand-new vibration calibration
                    system.
                    I was the first person in the lab and the last one to leave to solve a complex calibration problem that
                    was affecting every precision measurement lab in the Air Force.
                    Ultimately, I was able to resolve a complicated problem using the system in a deployed environment and
                    help changed the way vibration calibrations were performed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I did amazing work in a precision measurement equipment laboratory for the Air Force, won multiple
                    Airman of the quarter and Non-commission officer of the quarter awards,
                    I always wanted to be in a career that suits my interest as well as excites me. My desire was brought to
                    life once I took my first Web Development Job with Pannos.
                    Applying what I learned in a real world setting while satisfying clients has been an amazing experience.
                    Being able to work on web-oriented projects would be a welcome experience that would further my
                    knowledge and an organization.
                    I would love to hear more about the employment opportunity and how I can do my part to elevate the
                    organization.
                    Please let me know if there’s any additional information I can provide.
